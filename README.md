# Chess game

## Overview

This is a simple attempt to create a little chess game with moves's validation, in order to practice my freshly acquired python skills.

## Requirements

This project requires python3

## Install

Clone the repository :

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/mikachou/chess
```

## How to use

Go into project's directory and execute `cli.py` :

```
python3 cli.py
```

Players enter moves by typing them using [UCI protocol's](http://wbec-ridderkerk.nl/html/UCIProtocol.html) move format :
> The move format is in long algebraic notation.

Examples:  e2e4, e7e5, e1g1 (white short castling), e7e8q (for promotion)
